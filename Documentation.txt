This is the documentation for the frontend of the admin panel.

OVERVIEW
this is written in react.js, if you're not fammilier with the language, W3 schools has some great rescoures
We chose to use functional components and hooks in our project instead of doing the state components with the lifecyle
This was done to keep the components more modular and flexible

COMMANDS TO USE
running the program: cd into this directory and run npm start

STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM
The code is located in the /src directory and is split into two groups
/src/components/ holds all the individual components for the various views. 
    The exception to this rule are some of the dropdown buttons which are in the view files
/src/views/ hold the top level components for each view
