This is the documentation for the frontend of the admin panel.

OVERVIEW
this is written in react.js, if you're not fammilier with the language, W3 schools has some great rescoures
We chose to use functional components and hooks in our project instead of doing the state components with the lifecyle
This was done to keep the components more modular and flexible

ENVIROMENT VARIABLES
there are several variables that are stored within the .env file
all variables need to start with "REACT_APP"
variables:
    REACT_APP_CREATE_ORGANIZATION_PASSWORD - this sets the password that admins need to create an organization
    REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN - domain for auth0
    REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID - id for auth0
    REACT_APP_API_KEY - our API key
    REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY - our google api key

COMMANDS TO USE
running the program: cd into this directory and run npm start
you might need to run <npm i> before that or npm install <package>

SECURITY
We decided to use auth0 to handle creating accounts and logging in

STYLING
Most of the styling was done with inline css
We used bootstrap and this cut down the amount of styling that we had to do

STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM
The code is located in the /src directory and is split into two groups
/src/components/ holds all the individual components for the various views. 
    The exception to this rule are some of the dropdown buttons which are in the view files
/src/views/ hold the top level components for each view
